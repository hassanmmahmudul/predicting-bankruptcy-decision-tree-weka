# Bankruptcy Prediction Using Decision Tree Classifiers in WEKA
## IEEE standard research paper
***Abstract<br/>
Data Mining, discovers and extracts useful patterns
from large set of data to find observable patterns. This paper
been worked with supervised data [1]. All the data are considered
for training purpose, and it is used in the five-classification
algorithm, this paper presents the analyze and accuracy of
probable bankruptcy based on seven different nominal attribute
using data mining algorithms for various decision tree
approaches using WEKA. Five classification algorithms such as
J48, Random Tree (RT), NaiveBayes, REPTree and Random
Forest (RF) are used to measure the accuracy. Data mining tool
WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) has used
for performing such five classification algorithms, RandomForest
algorithm outperforms other algorithms by yielding an accuracy
of 100%.</br></br>Index Termsâ€”Data mining, bankruptcy, weka, random tree, J48, RandomForest.***
